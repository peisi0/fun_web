# OurChat (WeChat Web Clone)

A lightweight, single-page web application replicating the WeChat (Weixin) interface. Built entirely with **Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, this project demonstrates how to build a complex, mobile-responsive UI and a simulated AI chat bot without external frameworks like React or Vue.

## ⚡ Key Features

### 🖥️ User Interface
* **Dark Mode Design:** Built with a native dark theme using CSS variables (`--bg-color: #111111`).
* **Mobile-First Architecture:** Optimized for touch devices with `user-scalable=no` and specific viewport handling to manage virtual keyboards.
* **Single Page Application (SPA) Feel:** Smooth tab switching and sub-page sliding animations using Vanilla JS class toggling.

### 🤖 Functional Modules
* **Integrated AI Assistant:**
    * A rule-based chatbot implemented in local JavaScript.
    * **Capabilities:** Tells jokes, remembers context (e.g., if you ask for "another" joke), and handles basic greetings.
    * **Simulation:** Mimics network latency with random timeout delays before replying.
* **External AI Config (Editable):**
    * The chatbot keyword groups, response content libraries, translation dictionary, and intent priorities are configurable in `ai-config.json`.
    * `index.html` loads `ai-config.json` at runtime and falls back to built-in defaults if loading fails.
* **Real-time Search:** A functioning search bar in the "Chats" tab that redirects queries to Google.
* **Interactive Settings:** Toggle switches and navigation menus that mimic the real app's behavior.

### 🛠️ Technical Highlights
* **Zero Dependencies:** No build tools (Webpack/Vite) or frameworks required. Just standard web technologies.
* **CSS Variables:** Easy theming via the `:root` scope.
* **Flexbox Layouts:** utilized for the complex chat bubbles and list items.

## 📂 Project Structure

The project is designed to be simple. The core logic lives in `index.html`.

```text
/
├── index.html        # Contains HTML structure, CSS styles, and JS Logic
├── ai-config.json    # External AI keyword/content/priority configuration
├── manifest.json     # (Optional) For PWA installation support
├── icon.png          # (Optional) App Icon
└── README.md

## 🔧 Customize AI Assistant

Edit `ai-config.json` to tune behavior without touching JavaScript code:

* `keywordGroups`: add/remove trigger words
* `contentLibraries`: update jokes, quotes, tips, fallbacks, etc.
* `translateDict`: add quick translation pairs
* `capabilityMenuItems`: update help menu display
* `intentPriorities`: change intent routing precedence
